# hello-world
This is my first Github repository
My name is Daniel, you can also call me Danzobi and I am a cool guy generally. 
I am currently undergoing a training in software engineering and I hope that by the end of the !2 months training, I will be a fullblown software engineer
So far, this is my personal update and I hope Github companionship will be the best decision ever.
